## Contributing to TimeSeries

The best way to contribute code is to fork the main repo and send a pull request on GitHub.  

Bug fixes should be done in the master branch. New features or major changes should be done in a feature branch.  Alternatively, you can send a plain-text patch to the [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/opentsdb-clients).

Please break down your changes into as many small commits as possible. 

Please respect the coding style of the code you're changing. TimeSeries uses Rubocop to adhere to the Ruby style guide.
